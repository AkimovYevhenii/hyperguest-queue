# Suggested Improvements

* **Separate orchestration**: Extract startup, task distribution, and shutdown logic into a dedicated component.
* **Keep queue simple**: Retain a pure FIFO implementation and move key-based locking to a separate lock manager.
* **Graceful worker lifecycle**: Implement clean startup and shutdown for workers instead of infinite loops.
* **Retries & timeouts**: Introduce retry policies and visibility timeouts to avoid tasks getting stuck in progress.
* **Lookup-based handlers**: Replace large switch/case blocks with a registry-driven operation handler.
* **Robust error handling**: Define clear fallback paths and recovery flows for queue or database failures.
* **Testing strategy**: Add unit and integration tests for core components (queue, workers, database).
* **Abstraction layer**: Introduce interface-like abstractions for queue and worker to enable future transport/backends.
